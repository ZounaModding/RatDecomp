# Monopoly Folder
The "Monopoly" folder includes extracted pdb information from the game "Monopoly Plus", specifically the June 27th, 2014 prototype. This is for a decently later version of the engine, there are however still a lot of similarities between basically everything.

This includes:
* Enums and class definitions for many of the game's classes.
